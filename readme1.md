-   `chickens` = 2 legs
-   `cows` = 4 legs
-   `pigs` = 4 legs

The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the **total number of legs** of all the animals.

animals(2, 3, 5) ➞ 36

animals(1, 2, 3) ➞ 22

animals(5, 2, 8) ➞ 50
```

## 3. Even Or Odd

The return value should be a string (`"odd"` or `"even"`).

If the input array is empty, consider it as an array with a zero (`[0]`).

### Challenge

```
evenOrOdd([0]) ➞ "even"

evenOrOdd([1]) ➞ "odd"

evenOrOdd([]) ➞ "even"

evenOrOdd([0, 1, 5]) ➞ "even"
```

## 4. Calculate Area of Rectangle
Given an integer, calculate the area of the rectangle.

the input of the parameter must be integer

### Challenge

```
rectangle(5) ➞ 25

rectangle(10) ➞ 100

rectangle(72) ➞ 5184

rectangle(34) ➞ 1156
```
## 5. Calculate Area of Rectangle
Given 2 parameter, array and string. calculate whether this method must be divide, sum, substract, or multiplication

ex: `calculator([3,2], "*") => 6`

### Challenge

```
calculator([3,2], "*") => 6`

calculator([10,2], "/") => 5`

calculator([76, 12], "+") => 88`

calculator([789,10], "-") => 689`
```
